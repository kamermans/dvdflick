Version 1.2.1.4
 - Added: Improved support for MPEG type container files.
 - Added: Option to specify the amount of threads FFmpeg uses. This is set to the number of logical CPUs by default. Multi-core and (less so) HyperThreading CPUs will get a significant speed boost from this when encoding video.

 - Fixed: Encoding fails when streams other than video or audio are present in the source file.
 - Fixed: When using the overscan advanced option, padding was not always a required multiple of 2.

 - Changed: Message displayed when a project's disc was full so that it cannot be misinterpreted as a full hard disk.
 - Changed: Updated DVDAuthor binaries to their latest versions (here I was thinking it had died).

Version 1.2.1.0
 - Added: Create chapters on every new video source.
 - Added: Custom dialog boxes.
 - Added: Automatic detection and fixing of AC3 or MP3 audio delay in AVI files, muxed by very naughty AVI muxers.

Because of a limitation of the MPEG-TS file format it is not easily possible to calculate the duration of a VOB file, thus all calculations which need this are completely wrong and odd results can happen. An "import DVD" feature is still planned for some later version.

Version 1.2.0 RC 4
 - Fixed: Keep encoded files and Two-pass encoding options were not remembered when pressing Use as defaults. Thanks to Guy Sturgis.

 - Fixed: Combinging files larger than 2 Gb is now also supported.
 - Fixed: Disc space meter was not filled if a custom video bitrate was selected.
